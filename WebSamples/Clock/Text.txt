Welcome to PDFsharp
PDFsharp is the Open Source library that easily creates PDF documents from any .NET language.
The same drawing routines can be used to create PDF documents, draw on the screen, or send output to any printer.

Version 1.30 is now available.

It can use either GDI+ or WPF.

It includes support for Unicode in PDF files.

It also includes MigraDoc Foundation which brings you all the high-level functionality not included in PDFsharp.

Version 1.30 demonstrates how to mix PDFsharp and MigraDoc Lite to create sophisticated documents.
